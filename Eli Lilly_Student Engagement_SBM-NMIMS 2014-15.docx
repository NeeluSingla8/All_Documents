Student Engagement at SBM, NMIMS (2014-2015)


Numerous companies associated with the School of Business Management, NMIMS, Mumbai tend to engage in Campus Engagement Activities all year round to involve with the student community. In many cases these activities/events are hosted as part of the organisations’ campus recruitment initiatives, wherein they use this platform to interact with and gauge the quality of the students.

Below are few of the forums and means which Eli Lilly could employ to engage with the students of SBM, NMIMS, Mumbai.



 

	GUEST LECTURES

Guest lecture series could be aimed at providing the students with necessary pointers to know Eli Lilly as an organization better. These sessions would also give the students an insight for stepping into the corporate world as MBA interns and Management Trainees. The topics of discussion could range from the Indian economy, macro-economic factors affecting the Pharmaceutical industry to subject specific sessions related to Marketing, Operations, HR, etc.

100-150 students from 2013-15 (II year) and 2014-2016 (I year) batch would be the target audience. This could be a heterogeneous mix of students from various specializations.

	WORKSHOPS

Managers in Pharma companies today have to manage rapidly changing business conditions. How can they align their people to new strategies, manage changing relationships and expand into new territories and businesses? The medium of workshops would help the budding managers to get new ideas, answers and approaches to help the companies they become a part of adapt to changes in Pharma and the global economy. This will also give the students a unique experience of directly learning from the executives of Eli Lilly.

The content and framework of such workshops could be designed by Eli Lilly in collaboration with the faculty of SBM, NMIMS Mumbai. Such workshops could be conducted over a period of 1-2 months on weekends or as per the availability of the executives from Eli Lilly.


	CASE STUDY COMPETITIONS

Eli Lilly could engage with the students through the medium of case study competitions. The cases could mirror the business challenges Eli Lilly handles every day. The students will get a chance to showcase their ability to evaluate real problems and develop workable solutions. This is a great way to practice thinking outside the box and prepare for the student’s career.

In order to strengthen our relationship further, we, at NMIMS, would request Eli Lilly to consider our proposal for being named as ‘Official Partner’ for such a competition. It would be a matter of pride and honor for us to host the launch of the competition at NMIMS campus. Details of the format and registrations could be provided during the launch.


	PANEL DISCUSSIONS

SBM, NMIMS hosts several panel discussions on its campus, where we have eminent and accomplished business personalities interact with our students for a session ranging from 1-2 hours. This is a platform for exchange of ideas with a goal of informing the students about a particular subject or issue. In most cases, 3 or more panelists share their knowledge and expertise after being asked questions in a format that allows some discussion.

We at SBM, NMIMS are working towards hosting a panel discussion particularly for the Pharmaceutical Industry soon and would be grateful if senior business leaders from Eli Lilly could take out some time and be a part of the same. This will typically help in mapping the expectations of Eli Lilly from the students to the outlook towards the Pharmaceutical Industry.






	STUDENT AMBASSADOR PROGRAM

A large number of students aspire for an internship and final placement with a brand like Eli Lilly. However, not all the students get such an opportunity and hence this initiative will give the students a chance to earn their place for a brief stint with the company. A few companies have utilised this platform extensively in the past to engage with our students.

This initiative will be similar to a live corporate project wherein interested students with creative acumen will apply for the position. These students will have to send their design samples according to the specifications and theme mentioned by Eli Lilly. These designs will be evaluated by the company on various parameters. The students who qualify will be selected for a short interview/discussion. The final set of selected students will be given the opportunity to work for branding activities across B-school campuses.

ROLE OF STUDENT AMBASSADORS
1.	Work closely on designing branding elements e.g. teasers, banners etc. These will be rolled out in B-school campuses at regular intervals.
2.	Ensure posters and emails are circulated among the students to generate brand awareness on campus.
3.	Create a social media buzz around various initiatives of Eli Lilly.


	CORPORATE PROJECTS

Over the years, our students have built an enviable reputation for delivering results of real value to our partners by working on real time business projects. Leading organizations across sectors have collaborated with us, with new partnerships continually being developed.

These projects give the students an invaluable experience of working as a project-intern on a challenging management issue, and the opportunity to apply their knowledge in the real world. Eli Lilly could engage with the students through this medium which will help the company benefit from fresh insights, commitment and intellectual rigor.
